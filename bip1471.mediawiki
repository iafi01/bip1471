<h2>The first graphic seed phrase converter system</h2><br>
==Introduction==
The system is written in c++ based on bip39, it has 12 words that give you access to the private key.<br>
So we have 12 words of a 2048 total words file equal to a mathematical rapresentation of 2^132<br>

==How it works?==
Each word has an index associated, the index is convert to bits (0 - 1) each one of that is a square white or black in a chessboard.
The chessboard is a bmp image file that you can print or copy on a paper.

==Why that==
We have different possibility to bury a secret like private key, i want to demonstrate that seed phrase word is not the only system we can use.
i believe in future will not be only seed phrase system, we probably will have more types of seed like images.

==Hopes==
I want to inspire the community to this change and create other opensource systems to convert secret key to other secret seed.

==Example==
<table>
<tr>
<td>stick</td><td>stool</td><td>kitchen</td><td>knee</td><td>fade</td>
<td>butter</td><td>ten</td><td>vapor</td><td>various</td><td>once</td><td>mesh</td><td>menu </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td colspan="3"><img src="./immagine.bmp" style="width:220px;height:240px;" /></td>
<td colspan="9">You now have your image seed that can be stored where you want<br> 
is not difficult at least write down on a paper and use that in addiction to seed phrase backup.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
